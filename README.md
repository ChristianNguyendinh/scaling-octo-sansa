pip install -r requirements.txt
npm coming soon

currently only http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/info/"First Name"-"Last Name"/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/info/"Name"/ work

TODO:
- use npm for react, jquery, etc.
- split into components and use webpack to bundle
- make gulpfile
- facebook page search uses user api key, that is annoying. Find another source for profile pic or just use google image search.
- make search page
- make title bar
- convert to ES6
- use a custom sql database for practice?
- have twitter refresh everytime page is loaded
- have news articles refresh once a day? -- have to delete old ones
- Handle API failures more gracefully
  
######
REAL TODOS:
######

- add actual css
- add a spot for the type i.e singer/songwriter, etc. -- get it from googles api
